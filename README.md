The application will be designed to help farmers organize their working day by communicat-
ing jobs and orders to be completed. It will also provide an extra feature of tools to help with
reoccurring daily tasks that can be prone to human error.

#### It will include the following features:
- Allow managers to create a new “farm” on the app and allow staff to join the farm
using a farm ID and password.
- A scheduler that can be set by the farm manager and viewed by staff.
- Have a orders board that the manager can add new customers and products to. Staff
can then view the orders and mark off what has been completed and see what needs to
be done.
- A tailored calculator to help staff quickly find the most efficient method to stack
palletised crates for various products and customers. The manager can make a new
product profile which takes parameters such as crate size, pallet size and pallet height
for staff in their farm to download and use.
- A tailored finished product estimator that will allow the user to enter the number of
units they have of raw produce and estimate how many units of finished products this
will make. Profiles will again be made by the manager by entering product related data
and details of the finished product which can be downloaded by the staff to use.


## Timetable
The Timetable feature will allow managers of a farm to set the time table for each individual
user in the farm by setting a start time, end time name and description. Users can see their 
day and the tasks that need to be completed in the same view. They can then cycle through
the days. 

#### The timetable should have the following requirements.

- Allow only manager uses to create a tasks.
- Allow manager to create a task by setting a date, a start time, end time and task name.
- Manager can assign task to individual employee.
- The manager can select any employee to view their timetable.
- Employee users can only see their timetable with no options to edit.
- Employees can change the date and view previous dates and future dates if the manager
has assigned them tasks.
- Tasks should be in half an hour time slots where only one task can be scheduled in
each time slot.
- Time Table should update in real time when a manager updates a users timetable while they
have the screen open.

## Orders Board
Managers can add add customers and the products they buy to their own farms order board
that will be displayed for everyday in a list. The manager can then add a quantity to customers
products for a particular date. Farm staff can then access the order board and check that days
orders and cycle forward and backwards dates to view upcoming or previous orders.

#### The orders board should meet the following requirements.

- Allow a manager to add new customers and products for those customers.
- Manually add new a new quantity for customers products when they make an order
and set the status to either complete or not.
- Employees and manager can go forward and back dates to view previous and future
orders.
- Employees and manager can select any product and change its status to complete or
not.
- Updates in the timetable should be updated in realtime across all user devices. This 
includes managers updating with anew or edited order or users marking orders off as complete.

## Produce Estimator Tool

The produce estimator tool allows for users to quickly estimate how many raw units need
to harvested in order to fulfill an order of finished products. It does not give any monetary
value, it instead gives a quantity of goods that need to be harvested to fulfil an order. This
tool will allow users to quickly and accurately estimate how much production capacity they
need to fulfil an order or how much their current stock can produce. The manager enters
the parameters for each product which is saved to the cloud and all users can access the
profiles. Users then select the product they are doing and enter in the total number of finished
products they need. The tool will then tell them how many raw units will be required to
fulfil that order. The tool will also work the other way allowing users to enter in how many
raw products and the tool will tell them how many finished products that will produce.

#### The produce estimator tool should meet the following requirements:
- All manager to create a new product profile by inputting values that will then be saved.
- Manager can update or delete existing profiles.
- Employees and manager can select any saved product from a drop down menu.
- Employees and manager can then input the amount ordered and get an accurate value
back of how many units they must harvest to fulfill that order.

## Shipping Calculator Tool

This tool is used to help farmers quickly and accurately calculate how many total number of
boxes in an order can be best stacked onto pallets for transport and shipping. It also does not
give any monetary figure or deal with payments, but instead a gives staff a quantity amount.
Many farms use different styles and sizes of boxes and pallets for transporting their goods. It
is important to be able to calculate the most efficient way to transport these goods without
making mistakes which can lead to the incorrect amount of goods being sent to the customer.
This feature of the app will allow a farm manager to create product profiles by inputting
parameters that can be saved and shared among staff. These parameters are then placed
into an equation which will calculate the correct and most efficient way of transporting that
particular product. The advantage of using this tool is that it saves time for staff who are new
and provides an accurate count for all staff.
The manager will add in how many boxesor crates they prefer to put on each pallet. 
They can also add in the max amount they want to put on each pallet. 
The user can then select the product they want and load the parameters
set out by the manager. They can then enter the total quantity and the app will tell the user
the best way to package the products.

#### The shipping calculator tool should meet the following requirements:

- Only manager can create a new product profile by inputting values that will then be saved.
- Manager can update or delete existing profiles.
- Employees and manager can select any saved product from a drop down menu.
- Employees and manager can then input a quantity and get an accurate value back.
